This is a simple webpage monitor. My girlfriend wanted me to keep refreshign a webpage to see whether there are new sunglasses in the online store. So I write this script. 
Set the url to the webpage and the information of the target you want to monitor in the source code. Then run the script, it will play an alarm aduio file when the target changes.
